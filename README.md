# CustomModPack
Minecraft Modpack merging HexMC and fabulously optimised

## Install 
This modpack uses the quilt loader, instead of forge for faster, more optimised gameplay, It is recommended to use the [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/) to install the modpack
### Prism Launcher
Open Prism Launcher then navigate to Add instance -> Import from Zip with the pack downloaded from [releases](https://github.com/BulkiestPizza/custommodpack/releases/tag/Release) named PrismLauncher.zip after that launch the instance that you just imported

### Manunal install - Using Minecraft Launcher
First download the quilt loader from [quiltmc](https://quiltmc.org/en/install/client/) choose version 1.18.2, keep loader version the default and install location default then click install

Next open Minecraft launcher, go to Installations in the top bar, hover over quilt-loader and click on the folder icon, when the file manager comes up create a folder named "mods" and extract the ziip downloaded from [releases](https://github.com/BulkiestPizza/custommodpack/releases/tag/Release) Named OnlyMods.into the folder, after that change the installation on the front page to quilt loader and it should work

## Final Notes
If you are suffering performance issues it is recommended to adjust the amount of memory assigned to the game, pefhaps from 2 to 4GB or even 8GB

If you get a failed to start minecraft message from launching via minecraft-launcher, you will need to download 1.18.2 vanilla via the minecraft launcher by selecting New Installation from the installations tab, changing the version to release 1.18.2 (not the quilt one), wait for it to download and launch minecraft, close minecraft and launch quilt again.
